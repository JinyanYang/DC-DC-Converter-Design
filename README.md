# DC-DC Converter Research & Design

This repository presents my work on DC-DC converter design, including theoretical analysis, simulation, and performance evaluation.  
The project was originally prepared as part of an academic assignment and has been adapted into a GitHub research-style portfolio.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on the design and analysis of a DC-DC converter:
- Investigated the operation principle of buck/boost converters.
- Developed a theoretical design with relevant equations.
- Conducted simulations to validate performance (efficiency, voltage regulation).
- Analyzed results and compared with expected outcomes.

## Key Features

1. Theoretical Analysis
   - Converter equations
   - Component sizing

2. Simulation
   - Circuit schematic
   - Time-domain response (voltage, current waveforms)

3. Results
   - Efficiency vs load curve
   - Output ripple voltage

## Example Figures

- Example circuit schematic  
- Output waveform (voltage ripple)  
- Efficiency graph  

## How to Use
